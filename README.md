#School Management System
I began developing this app during my 11th grade. I wrote most of the code, covering key features such as notifications, management, interaction, UI/UX, and hosting. While the app functioned well and met the core requirements, it wasn't scalable and incurred high charges on the Firebase platform. After consulting with one of my computer teachers, I decided to put the project on hold.
At that time, I wasn’t familiar with Git or GitHub, so all the code was saved on Google Drive, which I’ve uploaded here. The code may not be fully compatible with current versions due to updates and new dependencies, but it worked smoothly back then.
